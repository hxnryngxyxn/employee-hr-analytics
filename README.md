# Employee HR Analytics

A SQL project simulating an HR database for analyzing employee performance, department growth, and salary trends. Built to demonstrate relational schema design, data modeling, and query-based business analysis using standard SQL.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project models a simplified human resources system, including employees, departments, performance reviews, and salary history. It includes realistic sample data and SQL queries that answer common business questions like:

- Whatâ€™s the average salary per department?
- Who are the top performers?
- Which departments are growing or underperforming?
- How has salary changed year-over-year?

## ðŸ§± Schema

- **departments** â€” Reference list of departments  
- **employees** â€” Employee info (name, hire date, salary, department)  
- **performance_reviews** â€” Yearly review scores (1.0 to 5.0)  
- **salaries** â€” Salary history records per employee (optional)

You can view the schema in [`schema.sql`](./schema.sql).
